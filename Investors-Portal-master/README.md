# Investors-Portal
This is a website where a startup could register to find potential investors brought through us.
This was a Project made by me under the course Internet and Web Programming in October 2017.

I have made use of the CSS file from https://www.w3schools.com/ provided by them for developing such projects.

This webapp is to be used by the startups that want some fundings and looking for investors.
We have a homepage giving all the necessary description of the features that the app has to offer.
There is a Sign Up as well as Login Page.
We have a dashboard for the users to view all the progress.
We also have a settings page for the user.
